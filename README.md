## Quick Start (Docker)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/CarbonRaven/AWS-Quiz-SAA-C03.git
cd AWS-Quiz-SAA-C03

# (Optional) Set a secret key for persistent sessions across restarts
# If not set, a random key is generated on each startup
export SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)

# Start the application
docker-compose up -d

# Access the quiz
open http://localhost:5050
```

## Quick Start (Local)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/CarbonRaven/AWS-Quiz-SAA-C03.git
cd AWS-Quiz-SAA-C03

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
cd aws-quiz
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Import questions and start
python import_questions.py
python app.py
```

Access the quiz at `http://localhost:5050`

## Question Format

Questions are stored as JSON files with the following structure:

```json
{
  "question_number": 1,
  "topic": 1,
  "question_text": "A company collects data for temperature...",
  "options": {
    "A": "Turn on S3 Transfer Acceleration...",
    "B": "Upload the data from each site...",
    "C": "Schedule AWS Snowball Edge...",
    "D": "Upload the data from each site to EC2..."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "community_vote": {
    "A": "94%"
  }
}
```

## Adding Custom Questions

1. Create a JSON file in `questions/` following the format above
2. Rebuild the Docker container or re-run the import:

```bash
# Docker
docker-compose build --no-cache && docker-compose up -d

# Local
python import_questions.py
```

## Spaced Repetition Algorithm

The application uses the SM-2 algorithm to optimize review scheduling:

- **Correct answers** increase the interval between reviews
- **Incorrect answers** reset the question to immediate review
- **Ease factor** adjusts based on performance history
- Questions are tagged as "due" when their next review date arrives

## AWS Services Covered

The question bank covers 89 AWS services including:

| Category | Services |
|----------|----------|
| Compute | EC2, Lambda, ECS, EKS, Fargate, Batch |
| Storage | S3, EBS, EFS, FSx, Storage Gateway |
| Database | RDS, Aurora, DynamoDB, ElastiCache, Redshift |
| Networking | VPC, CloudFront, Route 53, API Gateway, Direct Connect |
| Security | IAM, KMS, Cognito, WAF, Shield, GuardDuty |
| Analytics | Athena, Kinesis, EMR, Glue, QuickSight |
| Integration | SQS, SNS, EventBridge, Step Functions |

## Docker Commands

```bash
# Start in background
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop
docker-compose down

# Rebuild after changes
docker-compose build --no-cache && docker-compose up -d

# Reset progress (delete volume)
docker-compose down -v
```

## Configuration

### Secret Key
Flask uses `SECRET_KEY` to cryptographically sign session cookies, which store your in-progress quiz state (current question, score, answers). Without a persistent key, sessions are invalidated whenever the app restarts — you'd need to start a new quiz session. Your quiz history and spaced repetition progress are stored in the SQLite database and are **not** affected.

For a personal study app, leaving it unset is fine. To persist sessions across restarts, set it using any of these methods:

**Option 1: Environment variable**
```bash
export SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
docker-compose up -d
```

**Option 2: `.env` file** (automatically read by Docker Compose)
```bash
echo "SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)" > .env
docker-compose up -d
```

**Option 3: Hardcode in `docker-compose.yml`**
```yaml
environment:
  - SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
```

### Password (required)
The app is gated behind a single shared password. It **will not start** unless `APP_PASSWORD` is set — this prevents accidentally exposing an open instance when hosting publicly.

```bash
# Docker Compose: put it in a .env file next to docker-compose.yml
echo "APP_PASSWORD=your-strong-password" >> .env
echo "SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)" >> .env
docker-compose up -d
```

Set a persistent `SECRET_KEY` in production too, so your login session survives restarts (see above).

### Deploying to Railway / Render / Fly.io
Host on a platform with a **persistent disk** — **not Vercel** (its filesystem is ephemeral, so the SQLite database and all your progress would be wiped on every cold start).

1. Point the platform at this repo; it builds `aws-quiz/Dockerfile` automatically.
2. Set environment variables: `APP_PASSWORD` (required) and `SECRET_KEY` (a fixed random value).
3. Mount a persistent volume at `/app/data` so `quiz.db` (your progress) survives restarts.
4. The container binds to the platform-provided `$PORT` automatically (falls back to 5050 locally).

### Port
Locally the app listens on `5050`. To change the host mapping, edit `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
ports:
  - "8080:5050"  # Access on port 8080
```

When deployed, the container honors the `PORT` environment variable set by the host (Railway/Render/Fly), defaulting to `5050`.

### Data Persistence
Quiz progress is stored in a Docker volume (`quiz-data`). To backup:

```bash
docker cp questions-aws-quiz-1:/app/data/quiz.db ./backup-quiz.db
```
